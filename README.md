<h2 align="center">AI Based Mask Detection System</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>It is used to detect whether people are wearing the masks or not</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

<div align= "center">
  <h4>Prevention is better than cure</h4>
</div>

✔WHO advises to wear mask and prevent touching Nose, Face and Eyes.<br />
✔There is no vaccine tillf now, and wearing masks is one of the only way to get rid of this virus.<br />
✔Prevention is the only way to control spread of Novel Corona Virus and will lead of flattening of curve.<br />

## :star: Unique Selling Point (Mask Detection System)

✔To check if the person is wearing mask or not.<br />
✔Red: mask Pink: no_mask : with their detection probabilities on top of each bounding box.<br />
✔This system is highly scalable and can detect multiple streams in optimal time.<br />
✔This has great use in surveillance and security purpose to find out who all are following the rules.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from existing CCTV/IP cameras and show the results.

## :clap: Use Cases

✔ Can be used at hospitals<br />
✔ Can be used at Railway Stations<br />
✔ Can be used at Crowded Areas<br />
✔ Can be used at Market Places and Malls<br />

<h2 align="center">AI Based Social Distancing Monitoring System</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>It is used to detect whether people are following the social distancing or not</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

✔ WHO advises to maintain social distancing.<br />
✔ Minimum permissible distance is 1 metre (3 feet).<br />
✔ Prevention is the only way to control spread of Novel Corona Virus and will lead of flattening of curve.<br />

## :star: Unique Selling Point (Social Distancing System)

✔ This is our AI Product to check if commuters in the monitored area are following Social Distancing or not.<br />
✔ Red: Alert, Green: Distancing maintained<br />
✔ Contrary to others, this system is highly scalable and can detect multiple streams in optimal time.<br />
✔ The USP is that distance between two people is independent of their heights as well as it can detect upto 1000 people in a single frame.<br />
✔ This system is based on Deep Learning and not on Conventional Computer Vision<br />
✔ Can be deployed on edge and cloud both.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from existing CCTV/IP cameras and show the results.

<h2 align="center">AI Based Redness of Eye Detection</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>This snippet of software will aim at detecting the people who are having conjunctivitis in their eyes</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

✔ Conjunctivitis(Red Eye) is considered as the symptom of Covid19 as per the guidelines of World Health Organization.
.<br />
✔ Our software detects red eyes and raises alert for probability of person being infected.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from existing cameras and show the results.

<h2 align="center">AI Based Fever Detection</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>This snippet of software will aim at detecting the people who have high body temperatures.</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

✔ We have considered the Human Face as Region of Interest to calculate the thermal temperature<br />

✔ Our system will couple AI Based ROI Detection + Temperature Calculation in ROI<br />

✔ Things to look for: If a person carries coffee or any hot food item, it won’t be considered for temperature calculation. <br />

✔ Our software detects red eyes and raises alert for probability of person being infected.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from thermal cameras and show the results.
